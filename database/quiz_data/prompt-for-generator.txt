I want you to create a Python program that generates quiz questions using the Gemini AI API with the following specifications:

Program Requirements:
1. Create a configuration file (preferably YAML) with the following structure:
   - Ability to define multiple categories
   - Each category should have:
     * A name
     * A detailed description that guides question generation

2. The Python script should:
   - Read the configuration file
   - Use the Gemini API to generate questions
   - Generate 50 unique questions for each category
   - Follow these question generation guidelines:
     * Questions must be relevant to UK audiences
     * Avoid questions with obvious answers
     * Include one correct answer and three plausible incorrect choices
     * Ensure questions are challenging but fair
     * Cover diverse and interesting aspects of the category

3. Implement robust error handling and logging
   - Log generation process
   - Handle API errors
   - Validate generated questions

4. Output requirements:
   - Save questions for each category in separate JSON files
   - EXACT JSON Structure (CRITICAL):
     ```json
     [
       {
         "question": "What is the specific question text?",
         "answer": "The correct, precise answer",
         "choice1": "First plausible incorrect answer",
         "choice2": "Second plausible incorrect answer", 
         "choice3": "Third plausible incorrect answer",
         "category": "Exact category name from configuration"
       },
       // ... 49 more questions following this exact structure
     ]
     ```
   - Validation requirements for JSON:
     * Must be a valid JSON array
     * Exactly 50 questions per category file
     * All fields must be non-empty strings
     * "category" must match the source category name exactly

5. Make the configuration file easily editable by humans
   - Clear, descriptive format
   - Simple to modify categories and descriptions

6. Use environment variable for API key
   - Secure method of API authentication

Additional Constraints:
- Questions should be unique within a category
- Incorrect choices should be:
  * Plausible at first glance
  * Clearly wrong upon closer examination
  * Related to the topic but not correct
- Maintain academic and factual integrity

Please provide a complete implementation including:
- Configuration file template
- Full Python script
- Instructions for setup and running the program
- Detailed comments explaining the logic

Ensure the solution is flexible, readable, and follows Python best practices.
